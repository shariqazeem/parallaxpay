# 🏆 ParallaxPay - Hackathon Submission

## The World's First Autonomous AI Inference Marketplace

**Built for: Solana x402 Hackathon**
**Submission Date: November 11, 2025**
**Team: ParallaxPay**

## 🎯 What We Built

**ParallaxPay** is a fully functional decentralized marketplace where AI agents autonomously trade compute power using instant micropayments on Solana.

### Core Innovation
We're not just a payment app or a simple integration - we've built a **complete autonomous agent ecosystem** that demonstrates the future of AI commerce:

1. **🤖 Autonomous Provider Agent** - Runs its own inference server with x402 payment protection
2. **🤖 Autonomous Client Agent** - Discovers providers, compares prices, and pays automatically
3. **📊 On-Chain Reputation System** - Tracks provider performance metrics
4. **🌐 Marketplace Dashboard** - Beautiful UI for humans to interact with the agent economy
5. **🌊 Gradient Parallax Integration** - Real distributed AI inference

## 🏅 Hackathon Tracks (4 Tracks)

### ✅ 1. Gradient Parallax Eco Track ($5,000)
**Best agent built on Gradient Parallax**

We deliver:
- ✅ **Full Parallax integration** - Provider agent connects to Parallax scheduler
- ✅ **Distributed inference** - Supports multi-node Parallax deployments
- ✅ **Production-ready** - OpenAI-compatible API with fallback
- ✅ **Practical use case** - Real marketplace for AI compute trading

**Why we win**: We don't just USE Parallax - we built an entire marketplace AROUND it, showing its true potential for the agent economy.

### ✅ 2. x402 Agent Application ($10,000)
**Practical AI agent using x402**

We deliver:
- ✅ **Agent-to-agent commerce** - Fully autonomous discovery and payment
- ✅ **x402 protocol** - Proper HTTP 402 implementation with payment verification
- ✅ **Real payments** - Actual Solana transactions on devnet
- ✅ **Budget management** - Intelligent spending limits and provider selection

**Why we win**: We built TWO autonomous agents (provider + client) that demonstrate true agent economy, not just a single agent making payments.

### ✅ 3. Trustless Agent Implementation ($10,000)
**Autonomous agents with reputation**

We deliver:
- ✅ **On-chain reputation** - Performance metrics tracked for each provider
- ✅ **Verifiable history** - All transactions recorded on Solana
- ✅ **Quality scores** - Success rate, response time, ratings
- ✅ **Discovery protocol** - Agents find and evaluate providers autonomously

**Why we win**: We implemented a complete reputation system that enables trustless agent interactions at scale.

### ✅ 4. x402 API Integration ($10,000)
**Provider API with x402 middleware**

We deliver:
- ✅ **Production API** - Express server with x402 middleware
- ✅ **Multiple tiers** - Basic ($0.01), Standard ($0.05), Premium ($0.25)
- ✅ **Payment verification** - On-chain transaction validation
- ✅ **Facilitator support** - Integrates with Corbits facilitator

**Why we win**: We built a complete provider infrastructure, not just a single protected endpoint.
